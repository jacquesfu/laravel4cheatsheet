Laravel 4 Cheat Sheet
==================

This is a collection of cheat sheets for the Laravel 4 PHP framework. 
The purpose is not to provide an exhaustive tutorial on how Laravel works, 
the [official documentation](http://four.laravel.com/docs/introduction) is fairly straightforward for that purpose. The goal of this cheat sheet
is to have a reference to save time hunting down or trying to remember commonly needed 
code snippets, class / method / helper names, and commonly used libraries.
